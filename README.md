# 🚀 Object Detection and Segmentation using YOLOv8

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Object Detection** and **Image Segmentation** using the **Ultralytics YOLOv8** model.  
It loads pretrained YOLOv8 models, performs detection and segmentation on sample images, and displays the results visually.

The purpose of this project is to understand how **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** works for detecting and segmenting multiple objects in real-time images.

## 🧠 What is YOLOv8?
**YOLOv8** (by [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)) is one of the latest and most efficient object detection algorithms.  
It can perform:
- 🟩 **Object Detection** — Locating objects and drawing bounding boxes.  
- 🟦 **Segmentation** — Identifying and coloring each object’s exact region.
